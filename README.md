# BreachAnalysis
## APT34 Threat Actor Assessment

## Overview :

This project presents an intelligence-led cybersecurity assessment focused on APT34 (OilRig), a known Iranian state-sponsored threat actor. Using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering techniques, I researched and analyzed APT34’s operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and developed actionable defense recommendations for an organizational client.

## Objectives

- Perform OSINT-based research on APT34 using reputable cybersecurity sources (e.g., Mandiant, CrowdStrike, Recorded Future, MITRE ATT&CK).
- Profile the threat actor's history, motives, methods, and notable activities.
- Identify defensive strategies and security measures tailored to counter APT34’s known TTPs.
- Produce client-ready deliverables, including a professional report and checklist for organizational use.

## Sources

Research was conducted through publicly available, credible cybersecurity intelligence resources, including but not limited to:
- Mandiant Threat Intelligence Blog
- CrowdStrike
- Recorded Future
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- CyberScoop
- Dark Reading
- The CyberWire

## Deliverables

- Threat Actor Profile: A detailed analysis of APT34’s background, objectives, and attack techniques.
- Defense Recommendations: A structured security strategy aimed at mitigating the specific threats posed by APT34.
- Client-Ready Report: Professionally formatted to meet the expectations of cybersecurity consulting clients.
- Executive Summary: High-level overview suitable for non-technical stakeholders.

## Skills Demonstrated

- OSINT collection and analysis
- Threat actor profiling
- Cyber defense strategy development
- Professional technical writing
- Security best practices alignment with frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK)
